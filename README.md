[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/dea98029aaf248538a413e26aa2a194a)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/userbotindo/Anjani/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=userbotindo/Anjani&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

A modular Telegram group management bot running with Python based on [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram).

Ca be found on Telegram as [Anjani](https://t.me/dAnjani_bot)

Help us to cover more languages by contributin translation in [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/anjani-bot)!


## Requirements
 - Python 3.8 or higher (recomended).
 - [Telegram API key](https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/setup#api-keys).
 - [Telegram Bot Token](https://t.me/botfather)
 - [MongoDB Database](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).


## Set Up

### Configuration
Set up your bot configuration variables by renaming `confing.env_sample` to `config.env` and edit it with your own values.

### Dependencies
Install all required dependencies by running
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Run
Once everyting set up, start the client by running
`python3 -m anjani_bot`

## Plugin

### Creating your own Modules

We try our best to simplify module creation.

All you need is a `<plugin-name>.py` file in `anjani_bot/plugins`.

Import the Listener `from .. import listener, plugin`.

Create a class that inherit with `plugin.Plugin` And give that Class name attribute to name the plugin. eg:

```python
from .. import listener, plugin

class PluginClass(plugin.Plugin):
    name = "plugin name"
    helpable = True

    # class function that don't need decorator
    # This sometimes need to simplify your main plugin
    async def hi(self, chat_id):
        # self have the client too!
        self.bot.client.send_message(
            chat_id=chat_id,
            text="hi again",
        )
        # for client refer to `~pyrogram.Client`

    # filters is Optional
    @listener.on("hello", filters=filter)
    async def hello(self, message):
        message.reply("hi")
        await self.hi(message.chat.id) # Simplified
```

Command Trigger can be a `string` or a `list of strings`.  
parameter `filters` is `pyrogram.filters` but it's optional.

The `__migrate__()` function is used for migrating chats - when a chat is upgraded to a supergroup, the ID changes, so it is necessary to migrate it in the DB.

Define a `boolean` class variable named `helpable` which shows that the plugin has a helper (documentation) to the `/help` command. Then you can make the string on `anjani_bot/core/languages` with `{name}-help` and `{name}-button` key. `name` here is the value of the name ClassVar.
